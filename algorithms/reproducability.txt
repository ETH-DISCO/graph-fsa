We ran the experiments with different model seeds to get the results for our paper (seed = 40 to 60). For the GraphFSA model you have to call 

python3 train.py --seed (x)

In addition, we have different datasets 

- Distance
- PrefixSum
- RootValue
- PathFinding

the respective dataset can be passed in with the --dataset command. 

For example 

python3 train.py --seed 40 --dataset Distance.


For the baseline models you have to use 

python3 train_baselines.py

before calling it you need to specify which baseline model will be trained. In the
beginning of the python script you have to set 

model_architecture = "gnca"

the three options are ["gnca", "graphchef", "recgnn"]

An example call is 

python3 train_baselines.py --seed 50 --dataset Distance 

For RecGNN you need to additionally set the learning rate to 0.001 for good result. 

python3 train_baselines.py --seed 50 --dataset Distance --learning_rate 0.001
